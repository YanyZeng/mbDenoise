Description: Zero-Inflated Probabilistic PCA with different distributions, including Poisson,
             negative binomial,and logistical normal multinomial (ZIPPCA-Poi,ZIPPCA-NB,ZIPPCA-LNM),
             propose variational approximation (VA) and extend variational approximation method 
             called classfic variational approximation (CVA) for comprehensive analysis of microbiome data, 
             which containing ordination, composition and differential expression analysis.
